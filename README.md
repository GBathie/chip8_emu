# Chip8 Emulator

Custom Chip8 emulator in `C++`.
Contains a finished simulation-based emulator, and a work-in-progress emulator that uses dynamic recompilation.  
A very good reference to implement your own chip8 emulator: [here](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/).

## Simulator

Uses `SDL2` for graphics and sound.

## Dynamic Recompilation

Work in progress
